    <h1>My Hobby - Video Games</h1>
    <p>
      I love playing video games in my free time.
      They’re a great way to be creative, get lost in stories, and test my skills.
      Sometimes I just relax with them, and other times I like a good challenge.
      I’m really into games with good stories, big worlds to explore, and fun multiplayer modes.
      Plus, gaming’s helped me hang out with friends.

      Deadlock is a fast-paced, competitive MOBA shooter developed by Valve.
      It takes place in a fantasy version of New York and features a 6v6 multiplayer format with unique characters, each with their own abilities.
      The game combines strategic team play with fast action.

    <p>
      The Binding of Isaac is a roguelike dungeon crawler known for its randomly generated levels.
      Players guide Isaac through a monster-filled basement using power-ups and strange items to survive.
      Each run is different, making the game highly replayable and challenging.

    <h3>Grounded 2</h3>

    <p>
      Grounded 2 continues the tiny survival adventure where players are shrunk down and must survive in a backyard full of bugs, secrets, and environmental dangers.
      With new enemies, tools, and areas to explore, it expands on the original’s gameplay and storytelling.
