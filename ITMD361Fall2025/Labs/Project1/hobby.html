  <h1>My Hobby - Video Games</h1>
  <p>
    I love playing video games in my free time.
    They’re a great way to be creative, get lost in stories, and test my skills.
    Sometimes I just relax with them, and other times I like a good challenge.
    I’m really into games with good stories, big worlds to explore, and fun multiplayer modes.
    Plus, gaming’s helped me hang out with friends.

    The Binding of Isaac is a roguelike dungeon crawler known for its randomly generated levels.
    Players guide Isaac through a monster-filled basement using power-ups and strange items to survive.
    Each run is different, making the game highly replayable and challenging.

    Grounded 2 continues the tiny survival adventure where players are shrunk down and must survive in a backyard full of bugs, secrets, and environmental dangers.
    With new enemies, tools, and areas to explore, it expands on the original’s gameplay and storytelling.
